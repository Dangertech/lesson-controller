# This is the location where the data about your lessons is stored.
# It is designed to be human readable so that you can easily edit it.
#
# lesson-controller is space- and linebreak agnostic while reading this
# and the timeframes.dat file, so you can format it pretty much however you want, BUT:
# Currently, the file is reset every time the program performs a write operation
# (Right now, at every successful termination)
#
#
# You have to enclose every day in curly brackets and every lesson in every day as well.
# The 3 Metadata that are stored (Subject, Teacher and Room) must be separated by commata.
# You can retrieve the stock configuration in case you messed up at https://github.com/Dangertech/lesson-controller
